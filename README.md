Command line tool to get strong typed, autocompleted localized strings in Swift, inspired by [R.swift](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift).

## Usage
After installing L.swift into your project you can use the L-struct to access localized strings. If the struct is outdated just build and L.swift will correct any missing/changed/added resources.

L.swift supports dot-separated keys.

|Key|L.swift|
|:---:|:---:|
|`"One"`|`L.one (return NSLocalizedString("One", comment: "")`|
|`"One.Two"`|`L.One.two (return NSLocalizedString("One.Two", comment: "")`|
|`"One.Two.Three"`|`L.One.Two.three (return NSLocalizedString("One.Two.Three", comment: "")`|

## Installation

### CocoaPods
1. Add `pod 'L.swift'` to your Podfile and run `pod install`
2. In XCode: Click on your project in the file list, choose your target under `TARGETS`, click the `Build Phases` tab and add a `New Run Script Phase` by clicking the little plus icon in the top left
3. Drag the new `Run Script` phase above the `Compile Sources` phase and below `Check Pods Manifest.lock`, expand it and paste the following script: `"$PODS_ROOT/L.swift/lswift" "$SRCROOT"`
4. Build your project, in Finder you will now see a `L.generated.swift` in the $SRCROOT-folder, drag the `L.generated.swift` file into your project and uncheck `Copy items if needed`
